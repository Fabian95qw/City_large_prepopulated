[h1]  What happens if a player steals a red item? [/h1] 
If a player steals a read item, and does not get caught (No-Line of Sight, and Sneaking) nothing will happen.
If the player gets caught, he'll get into a dialog that will get him arrested, and stripped of all items.
The Items are stored in a chest inside the prison.

[h1]  What's this about fast trave? There are no waypoints! [/h1] 
Fast Travel is done by interacting
